This repository is about a [Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/Berlinhouse1).
It will search rental appartments (Mietwohnung) in Berlin (district Charlottenburg, or somewhere else). Then automatically post on Twitter the average, min, and max of found results.

The main source to search on Immobilienscout24 is from https://github.com/balzer82/immoscraper
